# 3-wheel-omni-drive
a three wheeled robot that can move in all directions

# Description
the basic workflow of the bot is that it is capable of smooth and precise movement in all directions, controlled by a wired ps2 controller. the system enables control of speed and direction, allowing for forward, backward, lateral, and diagonal movement. the robot is well balanced and has a great precison especially during quick direction changes and when navigating confined spaces, while maintaing stability and control across ifferent surfaces.
